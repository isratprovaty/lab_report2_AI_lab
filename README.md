Here a 2D grid representing a maze, where each cell is either an empty space (0) or a wall (1). Now implement a Python program that uses Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) to determine whether a valid path exists from a given start cell to a specified target cell. Also may move up, down, left, or right to adjacent empty cells, but  cannot pass through walls, and each cell may be visited only once during a single path exploration.
